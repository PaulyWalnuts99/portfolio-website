      <h2>Level Goals and Overview</h2>
      <p>Bootlegger Bust is a level set in a Prohibition-era warehouse, designed to support the time period through environmental layout and visual structure. The primary goal was to create a readable warehouse space with clearly defined areas that guide player movement and support gameplay within the setting, focising on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Design</strong> a warehouse that reflected a prohibition-era industrial setting while remaining readable for gameplay</li>
        <li><strong>Organize</strong> distinct areas within the warehouse to help players understand space, progression, and purpose at a glance</li>
        <li><strong>Support</strong> gameplay by ensuring room sizes and sightlines were consistent and supported player flow</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Initial Blockout</h2>
      <p>The initial blockouts for Bootlegger Bust were designed to establish the warehouse layout and support player engagement, guiding movement, combat, and pacing throughout the level. Each blockout focused on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supported Player Mechanics:</strong> Created blockouts that provided spaces for combat, cover usage, and player navigation, reinforcing core gameplay flow within the warehouse</li>
        <li><strong>Provided Visual and Tactical Clarity:</strong> Arranged key architectural features, doors, and props to clearly communicate paths, cover, and engagement areas while staying consistent with Prohibition-era references</li>
        <li><strong>Contextualized Playspaces:</strong> Designed each room and corridor to feel intentional and connected to research and reference imagery, giving the warehouse a believable and purposeful layout</li>
