    <!-- Project Overview -->
    <section class="intro">
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>Bootlegger Bust was developed as part of a six-week collaborative level design assignment where we were tasked with designing a fully playable first-person shooter experience in Unreal Engine 5. The goal was to create a visually compelling and mechanically engaging environment using only free, publicly available assets. Working within this constraint encouraged creativity, efficient design practices, and smart use of available resources while maintaining a professional level of polish. As part of a level design team, I shaped the layout of key areas, refined the level’s pacing, and handled extensive set dressing throughout the experience.</p>

    <!-- Concept & Inspiration -->
    <section>
      <h3>Concept & Inspiration</h3>
      <p>The level takes inspiration from 1920s Prohibition-era crime and classic mafia imagery, set primarily inside a gritty industrial warehouse. The concept blends the feel of a criminal hideout with period-appropriate details—booze, cash, and contraband—to create an authentic atmosphere. While not a stealth game, it embraces a dark, moody tone through warm lighting and layered set dressing that reinforce the era’s tension and style.</p>

  <h2>Level Walkthrough</h2>
  <!-- Section 1: Starting Garage -->
  <div class="level-step">
    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>The level begins in a small, enclosed garage that sets up the narrative. The player is an agent tasked with infiltrating the warehouse. The garage features minimal, but moody lighting, emphasizing the objective and guiding the player visually toward the widgets on screen. Though compact, the space was designed to feel purposeful, establishing the tone for the more complex areas ahead.</p>

  <!-- Section 2: City Streets -->
  <div class="level-step">
    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>The city street outside the warehouse provides context and immersion, creating a lived-in environment. A level design technique we wanted to implement throughout the level was framing, and it starts here. As the player exits the car, the warehouse entrance is immediately framed by the surrounding streets and props, intuitively guiding the player toward their objective.</p>

  <!-- Section 3: Warehouse Part 1 -->
  <div class="level-step">
    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>Warehouse Room 1 is the first combat area. It features numerous cover points and clear sightlines to facilitate enemy engagements. The layout encourages forward movement along a critical path. Thoughtful set dressing adds industrial props and clutter, giving the space an authentic feel without obstructing player navigation.</p>

  <!-- Section 4: Warehouse Part 2 -->
  <div class="level-step">
    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>Warehouse Room 2 expands on the previous combat space but shifts in tone and atmosphere. Warm yellow-orange lighting casts a moody, vintage glow across the room, contrasting with the colder tones of earlier areas. Set dressing reinforces the theme of a Prohibition-era hideout — tables lined with bottles, scattered cash, and weapons give the impression of a criminal gathering spot. The environment tells a story through its props, immersing the player in the illicit underworld vibe while maintaining clear readability and player flow.</p>

  <!-- Section 5: Mini Boss Room -->
  <div class="level-step">
    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>The Warehouse Office serves as a focused one-on-one encounter that contrasts the larger-scale firefights of previous rooms. Red lighting heightens tension and gives the scene a dramatic, confrontational tone. A long table piled with guns and cash separates the player and the enemy, reinforcing the criminal atmosphere established earlier. Connected to the back storage area, this space provides a brief change of pace — an intentional slowdown that lets the player reset before beginning the final stretch.</p>

  <!-- Section 6: Storage Room -->
  <div class="level-step">
    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>The storage room diverges from the prior open layouts, offering a tighter, darker, more linear experience. Minimal lighting and dense shelving create a sense of tension and anticipation. Players must navigate carefully while anticipating enemy placement, providing a shift in pacing and reinforcing the sense of progression through the warehouse.</p>

  <!-- Section 7: Final Boss Room -->
  <div class="level-step">
    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>Don Luigi’s Office serves as the final showdown, delivering on the buildup established earlier through the intercom in the starting garage. The encounter is a true boss fight — a tense one-on-one duel between the player and Don Luigi himself. The room’s confined layout and moody lighting amplify the pressure, while the lavish props and decor emphasize Luigi’s authority and wealth. This final area ties the narrative and spatial progression together, providing a satisfying conclusion to the level’s escalation in both difficulty and atmosphere.</p>

    <!-- Whitebox / Blockout -->
    <section>
      <h3>Whitebox / Blockout</h3>
      <p>The whitebox phase focused on establishing the warehouse level’s core gameplay spaces and critical path, designed to last 2–5 minutes. The level begins with an outdoor approach, giving players an initial sense of scale and visual context before entering the warehouse. Inside, the first two warehouse rooms were blocked out to support linear FPS gameplay, incorporating verticality, strategic cover from crates and props, and sightlines that guided player movement. The second-story room was framed with a window to subtly signal the player’s objective, providing a visual cue without breaking immersion. The whitebox stage also allowed for early playtesting of pacing, enemy encounters, and player navigation. This iterative approach ensured that each space—outdoor entry, warehouse rooms, and the boss fight functioned as intended before adding detailed assets, textures, and props.</p>

    <!-- Iteration -->
    <section>
      <h3>Iteration Phase</h3>
      <p>During the iteration phase, we expanded the warehouse level to create a more lived-in city environment, adding detail and context to the outdoor approach and surrounding areas. A key addition was the storage area, placed after the first mini boss fight, which is a 1v1 encounter with a standard enemy, giving players a chance to practice their skills before shaking things up. The storage room’s design shifted from a relatively open floor plan to a darker, more linear space. Reduced lighting and tighter corridors created a distinct change in gameplay rhythm, offering players a fresh, unexpected challenge while staying consistent with the level’s aesthetic and overall vision. In parallel, we finalized the design of the final bosses room, refining its layout, verticality, and sightlines. This phase also involved setdressing and polishing the earlier warehouse rooms, adding props, cover, and visual detail to enhance navigation and atmosphere. The iteration stage allowed us to experiment with pacing, contrast, and player experience, ensuring that each section felt purposeful and engaging.</p>

    <!-- Final Renderings -->
    <section>
      <h3>Final Renderings</h3>
      <p>The final renderings showcase the fully realized warehouse level, highlighting the culmination of layout, lighting, and setdressing decisions. A new starting garage area was added in the final days to give the level narrative context: players assume the role of an agent tasked with infiltrating the warehouse and confronting the final boss. Though small, this area establishes the story and sets the tone for the level. The city street now feels integrated and dynamic, guiding players naturally toward the warehouse entrance while establishing the urban environment. Inside, Rooms 1 and 2 demonstrate careful attention to player flow, cover placement, and linear FPS gameplay. The storage area offers a contrasting experience with a darker, tighter layout, giving players a shift in rhythm before the main boss fight. Boss rooms combine visual storytelling and strategic design to create memorable encounters.</p>
