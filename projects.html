        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I am Paul Saturno, a level designer focused on creating immersive and engaging gameplay experiences. I enjoy building levels that feel intuitive, encourage exploration, and keep players invested from start to finish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am a senior at the University of Central Florida and will graduate in Spring 2026 with a bachelor’s degree in Digital Media – Video Game Design. I previously earned a bachelor’s in Business Administration from UCF in 2022. Together, these degrees allow me to approach game design from both a creative and strategic perspective.
