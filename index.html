        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Paul Saturno — a passionate level designer specializing in creating immersive gameplay experiences and atmospheric environments. I focus on thoughtful layout, lighting, and environmental storytelling to bring virtual worlds to life.</p>
        <p>My work draws inspiration from classic aesthetics, rich narratives, and player-driven exploration. I aim to craft levels that are both engaging and authentic, inviting players to lose themselves in the worlds I build.</p>
        <p>Academically, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Integrated Business from The University of Central Florida, and I am on track to graduate in Spring 2026 with a second Bachelor's degree in Video Game Design. This combination of business insight and creative expertise uniquely positions me to approach game development with both artistic vision and strategic understanding.</p>
        <p>Through a blend of art and design, I’m dedicated to pushing the boundaries of interactive storytelling and creating memorable player experiences.</p>
