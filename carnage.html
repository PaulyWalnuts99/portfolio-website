  <!-- Project Overview -->
  <section class="intro">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Carnage is a fast-paced mobile game inspired by Burnout 3: Takedown’s iconic Crash Mode. Players launch into dense traffic zones, chain explosive collisions, accumulate crash dollars, and compete for high scores through chaos and precision. Developed over 10 weeks in Unity 6, Carnage was designed to push the boundaries of mobile gameplay with its procedural generation system. Each session features dynamically selected city segments, randomized crashable objects, and rotating powerups — ensuring every run feels unpredictable and replayable. As the Lead Level Designer, I directed a team of four level designers to create multiple unique city environments that adapt to the procedural system. My role included defining level layouts, balancing traffic flow, integrating gameplay powerups, and maintaining visual and functional cohesion across all generated maps.</p>

  <!-- Goals & Constraints -->
  <section class="goals-constraints">
    <h2>Goals & Constraints</h2>
    <p><strong>Project Goals:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop a fun, fast-paced, and engaging mobile experience that captures the thrill of chaotic crashes</li>
      <li>Implement multiple levels, each with a distinct aesthetic and layout</li>
      <li>Create variants of each level to maintain freshness and replayability with every playthrough</li>
      <li>Utilize procedural generation and degeneration systems to optimize performance and ensure smooth gameplay on mobile devices</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Production Constraints:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The project spanned just 10 weeks, from concept pitch to final product</li>
      <li>Each member, including myself, balanced development alongside other classes and part-time jobs</li>
      <li>All game assets were created in-house by the team — the use of pre-made Unity asset packs was not permitted</li>
      <li>Leading four level designers occasionally required making compromises to balance differing design perspectives</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Concept & Inspiration -->
  <section>
    <h3>Concept & Inspiration</h3>
    <p>The concept for Carnage originated from my pitch to the team, inspired by my long-time love for Burnout 3: Takedown. While many student projects tend to focus on platformers, collectathons, or other small-scope ideas, I wanted to pursue something different — a high-energy driving game that brought large-scale chaos to mobile. A cel-shaded art style gave the project a distinctive and modern look while maintaining performance efficiency for mobile hardware. The combination of stylized visuals, procedural systems, and fast-paced driving gameplay immediately clicked with the team, and Carnage was born.</p>

    <div class="level-step">
      <div class="level-step-text">
        <p>This video focuses on testing the core driving mechanics of Carnage. We evaluated the feel of the car, ensuring that movement, turning, and speed felt responsive and fun. The team also tested the speed boost feature and how it interacts with player control, as well as collisions with other objects, which are central to the game’s crash-focused gameplay. This footage helped us validate the foundation of the game and identify adjustments needed to make the driving experience both satisfying and chaotic.</p>

  <!-- Whitebox / Blockout -->
  <section>
    <h3>Blockouts and Grayboxing</h3>
    <p>In the grayboxing phase, I created the initial blockout for our first level, San Francisco. Once the base layout was established, the other level designers iterated on it, rearranging buildings, modifying layouts, and creating new prefabs. This collaborative process allowed us to produce over 10 unique variants of San Francisco, with virtually infinite possibilities thanks to our procedural generation system. Personally, I created the original blockout plus five additional variants, helping establish the foundation for diverse and replayable city environments.</p>

  <!-- Iteration -->
  <section>
    <h3>Iteration Phase</h3>
    <p>During the iteration phase, the team focused on bringing the graybox levels to life by implementing art assets and began set dressing the city. Key systems and elements were added, including UI components, audio, and fully modeled city parts, giving each level a polished and cohesive look. The player’s car was implemented along with all powerups, and the procedural generation system was integrated to ensure levels remained fresh and varied on every playthrough. This phase was crucial for testing how all systems worked together in a visually complete environment and for refining gameplay before final tweaks.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Final Renderings</h3>
    <p>As of now, all core systems and features are fully implemented, and the team is focused on adding the “juice” that makes Carnage feel dynamic and alive. The game now includes two fully playable tracks, San Francisco and Las Vegas, each featuring iconic landmarks — the Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco and the Sphere in Las Vegas — for players to crash into. We added unique sounds for collisions with different objects, VFX for powerup pickups, and a car shop where players can purchase custom paint jobs with in game currency (Crash Dollars). Both levels are fully functional with all procedural generation systems active, creating a polished, engaging, and replayable experience.</p>

  <!-- Conclusion -->
  <section>
    <h3>Conclusion & Learnings</h3>
    <p>Over the course of this ten-week project, our team of level designers made significant progress in creating a playable and engaging mobile driving experience. Considering our limited experience with procedural generation and mobile optimization, we were proud of what we accomplished in such a short time. Looking back, we identified both key lessons learned and areas for improvement that will guide our future work, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating grayboxes and blockouts early allowed rapid iteration and testing of mechanics</li>
      <li>Collaborating effectively with multiple level designers to create variants and procedural systems</li>
      <li>Documenting design decisions to maintain clear team communication</li>
      <li>Managing scope and timeline in a 10-week project while balancing team members’ other obligations</li>
    </ul>
