  <!-- Section 2: Desert Area -->
  <div class="level-step">
    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>The desert level expands upon the player’s understanding of movement and navigation within a large, open environment. Featuring natural terrain with sweeping dunes and steep canyon walls, this area encourages exploration while introducing new gameplay challenges. Players encounter turret enemies, scattered debris fields, and a key point of interest (POI) that guides them toward their main objective—the wall. Additional POIs are visible throughout the landscape, offering optional encounters that enrich the world’s sense of scale and realism, while subtly directing the player’s curiosity toward future objectives.</p>

  <!-- Section 3: SORN Wall Room 1 -->
  <div class="level-step">
    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>The wall sequence shifts the tone from open exploration to tense, confined combat. The player infiltrates the massive enemy facility through a narrow vent, emerging into the first of several interconnected rooms. Here, they encounter drone enemies and moving supply trains that introduce new layers of environmental danger and spatial awareness. As a central hub for mech construction and transport, the wall’s industrial design emphasizes scale and danger, with shifting machinery and narrow combat zones that demand quick decision-making. The player’s objective dynamically updates with each cleared area, driving steady progression through the heart of the enemy stronghold.</p>

  <div class="level-step">
    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>Building upon the foundation of the first encounter, Room 2 expands the combat design by introducing verticality and layered traversal. Multiple elevation changes, platforms, and catwalks create opportunities for varied engagement—allowing players to approach enemies from above or below. This shift not only enhances spatial awareness but also reinforces the mech’s mobility and combat versatility. The layout encourages players to think strategically about positioning, using height and cover to their advantage while maintaining the fast-paced flow of combat established earlier in the level.</p>

    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>The final section of the level combines all the elements introduced throughout the mission—tight combat spaces, vertical traversal, and environmental hazards. Room 3 challenges the player to navigate a large, multi-tiered area filled with drones, turrets, and moving trains that demand constant awareness and precision. Players can explore both upper catwalks and lower sections of the facility, balancing risk and reward as they push toward their objective. The encounter culminates at the top of the room, where the player accesses a vent leading to the final chamber. There, they plant the explosive charge—completing their primary directive and signaling the end of the mission.</p>

      <h3>Building The Terrain</h3>
      <p>The building phase began with the creation of the desert terrain, which was procedurally generated and refined using customizable parameters to achieve natural dunes and realistic elevation variation. From the start, our goal was to design a level that felt expansive and open while maintaining a guided, mission-based structure—striking a balance between exploration and direction. This marks my first experience developing a large-scale, open-style environment, presenting unique challenges in navigation flow, player readability, and visual composition within a vast setting.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion & Learnings</h3>
      <p>The development of S.O.R.N has provided a valuable opportunity to tackle a full-scale 3D level with both environmental storytelling and combat-driven design. Throughout the process, we have navigated challenges ranging from procedural terrain creation to pacing multi-layered encounters, all while coordinating as a small, interdisciplinary team. Our iterative workflow emphasized testing, feedback, and refinement, which helped ensure the player experience remained engaging and cohesive. By the end of the semester, we will have a demo of our game that we are extremly proud of. Looking back, we identified both key lessons learned and areas for improvement that will guide our future work, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Documenting design decisions to maintain clear team communication</li>
        <li>Gained hands-on experience with CubeGrid for modular level design and layout planning</li>
        <li>Developed stronger proficiency with Unreal Engine’s foliage and landscape tools to create environments that feel natural and immersive rather than overly geometric</li>
        <li>Learned how to craft engaging, visually interesting environments while maintaining gameplay clarity</li>
        <li>Understood the critical role of team communication, as well as the need to maintain and update documentation consistently</li>
        <li>Importance of early layout planning for smooth gameplay</li>
        <li>Creating more detailed maps and blockouts early in development</li>
      </ul>
