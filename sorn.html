    <!-- Project Overview -->
    <section class="intro">
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>S.O.R.N is a 3D action mech shooter and my senior workshop project. As the level designer, I focused on creating engaging, challenging, and immersive environments that support player flow and combat strategy. Drawing inspiration from Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, I crafted levels that balance exploration, verticality, and pacing, highlighting both gameplay and narrative elements. The project serves as a capstone for my Video Game Design studies, demonstrating the skills and design approach I’ve developed throughout the program. The project is still in active development — our project was greenlit and awarded an additional 16 weeks to continue refining and expanding the game. S.O.R.N serves as the capstone project for my Video Game Design studies, showcasing the skills, design philosophy, and iterative approach I’ve built throughout the program.</p>

  <h2>Directive 1 Walkthrough</h2>
  <!-- Section 1: SORN Tutorial -->
  <div class="level-step">
    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>The tutorial introduces players to the fundamental mechanics of S.O.R.N, guiding them through core systems such as movement, targeting, and combat engagement. Designed to be unmissable and impossible to bypass, the desert testing ground was deliberately crafted to ensure every player receives proper onboarding. The terrain layout naturally funnels the player toward the test turret—so they must engage with essential mechanics before entering the open world.</p>

  <!-- Section 2: Desert Area -->
  <div class="level-step">
    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>The desert level expands the player’s understanding of navigation in a large, open space while still guiding them toward the main objective. Although the environment includes three POIs, the quest marker establishes a clear destination, with the first POI made intentionally unmissable as its guarding turrets draw the player into the encounter and help reinforce core controls. Once cleared, players naturally move toward the objective, where a giant laser turret introduces a high-pressure navigation challenge. The surrounding debris field is deliberately arranged as mandatory cover, forcing players to weave through it and manage line-of-sight to survive, ensuring the environment itself teaches pacing, spatial awareness, and strategic movement.</p>

  <!-- The Wall: Sector 1 -->
  <div class="level-step">
    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>The wall sequence shifts the experience from open-desert exploration to tight, controlled combat encounters. After infiltrating the facility through a narrow vent, the player enters a small storage room for a focused introduction to the Hermit—our newest enemy type—allowing them to engage it once before it reappears later in the mission. From there, the player is pushed into Sector 1, where enemy placements were deliberately arranged to create layered engagements across turrets, drones, and additional Hermits. The room’s set dressing reinforces both atmosphere and utility, providing meaningful cover and encouraging tactical movement. Two inactive trains occupy the space as well, acting as early visual foreshadowing for the larger train-based encounters that await deeper in the wall.</p>

  <!-- The Wall: Sector 2 -->
  <div class="level-step">
    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>After clearing Sector 1, players progress through the next vent and encounter a bounce pad, introduced in a safe space to foreshadow its upcoming importance. Entering Sector 2, the room immediately expands in scale and height, using verticality to build on everything taught previously. Bounce pads now become a core traversal tool, enabling players to reach upper platforms and reposition during combat. A moving train cuts through the room as an active hazard—damaging the player on contact—and forces constant spatial awareness as enemies apply pressure from multiple elevations. This sector intentionally ramps up difficulty by combining new mechanics, increased vertical depth, and environmental danger into a more demanding, multi-layered encounter.</p>

  <div class="level-step">
    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>Sector 3 transitions from the open, vertical spaces of the previous rooms to a tighter, more linear section, creating a deliberate shift in pace and aesthetic to keep the level engaging. Darker, moodier lighting, scattered debris, and broken scaffolding establish a sense of danger, while still providing paths for traversal and cover. Enemy placement remains dense, forcing the player to navigate carefully through constricted corridors and engage threats with precision. This section emphasizes tension, strategic positioning, and mastery of the movement and combat systems introduced earlier, offering a contrasting, high-stakes experience before the level progresses toward the final objective.</p>

  <!-- The Wall: Sector 4 -->
  <div class="level-step">
    <div class="level-step-text">
      <p>Sector 4 marks the climax of the mission with a cutscene, musical shift, and darker lighting, signaling the final challenge. The player faces the Wall’s commander in a straightforward 1v1 fight, testing the skills learned throughout the level. Defeating the commander opens an escape route. The player descends downn the hatch and moves through the vent which exits out the top of Sector 1. The player can now exit through the front doot of the wall, which was earlier sealed off and guarded by the powerful laser turret out in the desert. This design reinforces a sense of interconnectivity, rewarding players by allowing them to traverse previously unreachable areas while providing a clear, satisfying conclusion to the mission.</p>

    <!-- Building the Terrain -->
    <section>
      <h3>Building The Terrain</h3>
      <p>The building phase began with the creation of the desert terrain, which was procedurally generated and refined using customizable parameters to achieve natural dunes and realistic elevation variation. Since S.O.R.N is designed for monolith-scale worlds and encounters—with the player’s mech standing 30 feet tall—our levels had to reflect this scale, ensuring sightlines, traversal, and combat felt appropriately massive. From the start, our goal was to design a level that felt expansive and open while maintaining a guided, mission-based structure—striking a balance between exploration and direction. This was my first experience developing a large-scale, open environment, presenting unique challenges in navigation flow, player readability, and visual composition across a vast setting. With the terrain established, the next step involved placing points of interest and encounters to guide the player, introduce gameplay mechanics, and enrich exploration. These are the initial renderings for our desert landscape.</p>

    <!-- Desert Iteration Phase -->
    <section>
      <h3>Implementing Points of Interest</h3>
      <p>With the desert terrain established, the next phase focused on implementing points of interest (POI's) to guide player progression and introduce gameplay challenges. Key locations were carefully placed to balance exploration with mission objectives, ensuring the player naturally encounters essential mechanics while still feeling free to navigate the open environment. The first POI was designed to be unmissable, drawing the player in through environmental cues and turret engagement, while additional POIs offer optional exploration that reinforces the world’s scale and encourages strategic traversal. This phase allowed us to shape the desert experience, turning the raw landscape into a functional, engaging level.</p>

    <!-- The Wall Sector 1 Blockout -->
    <section>
      <h3>The Wall: Sector 1 Blockout</h3>
      <p>The initial blockout of Sector 1 focused on establishing the core layout and spatial flow within the Wall, transitioning players from the open desert into an enclosed, tactical environment. At this stage, the geometry was simplified to basic volumes, with key rooms, corridors, and pathways mapped out to accommodate the player’s 30-foot-tall mech. Emphasis was placed on maintaining readability and navigation at monolith scale, ensuring that sightlines, cover opportunities, and combat spaces felt appropriately massive without overwhelming the player. This foundational blockout allowed us to quickly test movement, traversal, and core combat flow, creating a solid framework for iterative refinement in subsequent phases.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>The Wall: Sector 1 Iteration Phase</h3>
      <p>Once the initial blockout was established, the iteration phase focused on refining the layout and gameplay using our modular kit. Leveraging a consistent world grid ensured that all pieces snapped together seamlessly, maintaining structural cohesion while allowing rapid adjustments. A major focus was on creating visually interesting geometry and dynamic rooms—avoiding simple boxes, sharp edges, and overly square layouts in favor of natural bends, flowing corridors, and spaces that felt organic while still functional for mech-scale traversal. Regular playtesting and team feedback guided adjustments to room shapes, pathways, and encounter placement, enhancing player flow and readability. This iterative process transformed the foundational blockout into a functional, engaging sector that balanced combat, traversal, and exploration within the Wall.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>The Wall: Sector 3 Blockout</h3>
      <p>The initial blockout for Sector 3 envisioned a massive vertical space filled with multiple moving trains, requiring the player to navigate complex platforming while engaging enemies on their ascent. The layout was designed to challenge traversal skills and spatial awareness, with paths winding around hazards and vertical elements emphasizing mech-scale movement. At this stage, the blockout prioritized the overall structure, spacing, and flow of encounters, establishing the framework for a high-intensity, layered combat and platforming experience before any visual detail or set dressing was applied.</p>

      <h3>The Wall: Sector 3 Iteration Phase</h3>
      <p>During the iteration phase, playtesting and team discussions revealed that the initial massive vertical design would be too ambitious given time constraints and workload. To maintain quality and ensure a polished experience, the team shifted to a smaller, tighter, and more linear layout—the version that appears in the game today. This new design preserved the challenge and tension of the sector while making it more manageable to develop. Feedback guided the placement of enemies, hazards, and traversal elements, ensuring that the tighter corridors still offered engaging encounters and maintained a sense of danger and progression through the Wall.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>The Wall: Sector 4</h3>
      <p>Sector 4 is the final, boss-fight area of the Wall mission. The room is compact and straightforward, essentially a single enclosed space with server terminals along the back wall. Because of its simplicity, there was no traditional blockout or iteration required—the focus was on creating a functional arena for the 1v1 encounter with the Wall’s commander, providing enough space for the player to maneuver and engage effectively. Sector 4 serves as the culmination of the Wall mission, where players face the Wall’s commander in a 1v1 encounter that tests all of the skills and mechanics learned throughout the level. The compact server room may be simple in layout, but it demands strategic use of movement and combat techniques, encouraging players to utilize everything at their disposal to defeat the boss. Once the commander is defeated, the player navigates the escape route—descending through a hatch and exiting via the vent above Sector 1—providing a satisfying conclusion that reinforces the level’s connectivity and progression.</p>
