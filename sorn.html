      <h2>Level Goals and Overview</h2>
      <p>S.O.R.N is a fast-paced, third-person mech shooter set across a monolith scale continent. This first level called "Directive 1" was designed to support strategic combat encounters in a semi open desert and a monlith sized facilitiy, while giving players freedom to move and engage dynamically. The level design goals for this project were to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Teach</strong> and reinforce core player mechanics through level layout and encounters</li>
        <li><strong>Guide</strong> players naturally through interesting and contextualized playspaces</li>
        <li><strong>Design</strong> enemy encounters that feel challenging and rewarding</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Research and References</h2>
      <p>The process for designing this level involved creating an environment that supported fast-paced mech combat while teaching players core systems. Key steps included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Research & Ideation:</strong> Studied mech-focused games (e.g., Armored Core) to analyze combat pacing, encounter design, and level flow</li>
        <li><strong>Reference Gathering:</strong> Collected visual references, concept art, and gameplay screenshots to inspire environmental design and thematic consistency</li>
        <li><strong>Miro Board Organization:</strong> Compiled references and ideas on a Miro board to map layouts, level goals, and design solutions visually</li>

      <p>The initial blockout was designed to support the core mechanics of S.O.R.N, giving players spaces to engage with combat, traversal, and exploration in a way that reinforced gameplay learning. This blockout focused on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supported Player Mechanics:</strong> Created blockouts and encounter areas that allowed players to engage with core mech abilities and understand combat pacing.</li>
        <li><strong>Provided Visual and Tactical Clarity:</strong> Arranged key environmental features to communicate paths, cover, and combat flow clearly while staying visually consistent with reference material.</li>
        <li><strong>Contextualized Playspaces:</strong> Designed level areas that reflected maps, concept art, and research references, ensuring each space felt intentional and meaningful.</li>

    <section>
      <h4 class="section-divider">Conclusion & Learnings</h4>
      <p>Developing S.O.R.N’s first level provided a hands-on opportunity to create large-scale 3D environments that balance exploration, combat, and player guidance. Iteration and refinement were key to ensuring pacing, flow, and engagement remained compelling throughout each encounter. Key takeaways include:</p>

      <p><strong>Knowledge Gained:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gained experience in effectively blocking out levels and using Unreal Engine tools like CubeGrid, landscaping, and foliage</li>
        <li>Designing with purpose, ensuring every prop, encounter, and space reinforces gameplay or narrative</li>
        <li>Communicating level design concepts clearly through maps, diagrams, and reference visuals</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Areas for Growth:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Exploring more creative layouts and prop placement to enhance player experience</li>
        <li>Applying feedback effectively while maintaining a cohesive level design</li>
        <li>Balancing challenge and guidance to better teach player systems through level design</li>
