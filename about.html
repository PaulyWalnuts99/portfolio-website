        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Paul Saturno, a level designer focused on creating immersive and engaging gameplay environments. I specialize in level layout, lighting, and environmental storytelling to craft spaces that feel alive and support player experience.</p>
        <p>I approach level design through experimentation, feedback, and iteration, shaping spaces that guide players naturally while encouraging exploration. My goal is to make each level intuitive, engaging, and memorable, balancing challenge and flow so players stay immersed.</p>
        <p>Academically, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Integrated Business from The University of Central Florida, and I am on track to graduate in Spring 2026 with a second Bachelor's degree in Video Game Design. This combination of business insight and creative expertise uniquely positions me to approach game development with both artistic vision and strategic understanding.</p>
        <p>I’m passionate about pushing level design to create compelling, playable spaces that resonate with players and leave a lasting impression.</p>
